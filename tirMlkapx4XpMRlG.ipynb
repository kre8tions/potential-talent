    "## Potential Talent\n",
    "#### Context\n",
    "We are a talent sourcing and management company helping tech firms find top candidates. This is challenging because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We must deeply understand client needs.\n",
    "- We must know what makes a candidate stand out.\n",
    "- Finding the right talent is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, our process is manual and labor-intensive. To streamline it, we want to build a machine learning pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Predicts candidate fitness for a given role.\n",
    "- Ranks candidates accordingly.\n",
    "- Adapts rankings when we “star” a candidate as ideal, reordering based on that feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "We source candidates via keyword searches (e.g., “full-stack software engineer”, “engineering manager”, “aspiring human resources”). After generating a list, we manually review and sometimes select candidates further down the ranking. Our goal is to automate re-ranking based on such supervisory signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Description\n",
    "Our dataset anonymizes candidates with unique IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- id: candidate identifier (numeric)\n",
    "- job_title: candidate’s job title (text)\n",
    "- location: geographical location (text)\n",
    "- screening_score: candidates were screened (numeric, 0-100)\n",
    "\n",
    "Target:\n",
    "- fit: candidate’s fitness for a role (numeric, probability 0–1)\n",
    "- Sample keywords: “aspiring human resources”, “seeking human resources”\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals\n",
    "- Predict candidate fitness.\n",
    "- Rank candidates by fitness score.\n",
    "- Re-rank dynamically when candidates are starred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Success Metrics\n",
    "- Improved candidate ranking accuracy.\n",
    "- Robustness of re-ranking after feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus\n",
    "- Methods to filter out irrelevant candidates.\n",
    "- Defining cut-off thresholds without losing strong fits.\n",
    "- Reducing human bias through further automation.\n",
    "- Explore GenAI solutions using prompt engineering"

    "Generative AI is the closest to a human reasoning and most accurate in matching candidates with the recruiter's search terms, even with no shot prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The limitation is that it is more computationally expensive, time intensive and can hallucination. We see one search term didn't provide any results. \n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations could be overcome if paired with a preprocessing step such as feeding it through less complex NLP methods beforehand. \n",

    "For future studies, other LLM models, as well as, other Generative AI enhanced techniques could be tested for better speed and performance but this has worked very well for this use case. "
